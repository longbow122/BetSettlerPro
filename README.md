# BetSettlerPro
For when you're too drunk to partake in a bar fight, use this. Get Settling!

## Instructions for Use For Admins
Admins can use the [Admin Bypass Command](https://github.com/longbow122/BetSettlerPro/blob/master/src/main/java/me/longbow122/BetSettlerPro/utils/Utils.java#L128 "Click me!") to add and delete users from the main bsp file. (File is formatted using [YAML Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#:~:text=YAML%20(a%20recursive%20acronym%20for,is%20being%20stored%20or%20transmitted. "Click me!"))

### For the Players
Firstly, ensure that an admin has added credentials for you that you're happy to use. Once you've done this, ensure that you can login just fine. You'll need around two players to play this game to its ***maximum potential***.
